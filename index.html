    <h1>Arick Schaibly</h1>
      <p>Always looking for new creative ways to solve todays problems for tomorrow.<br>
          I love to meet new people and share ideas to come to the best possible solution<br>
          while still maintaining excellence.  I was brought up with the idea that anything <br>
          worth doing is worth doing to the best of my ability and I still hold those ideas<br>
          close to my heart and mind.
