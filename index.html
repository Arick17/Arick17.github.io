      <p>Always looking for new and creative ways to solve today's problems for tomorrow.<br>
          I love meeting new people and sharing ideas in order to achieve the best possible solution<br>
          while still maintaining excellence.  I was brought up with the idea that anything <br>
          worth doing was worth doing to the best of my ability, and I still hold those ideas<br>
          close to my heart and mind.
